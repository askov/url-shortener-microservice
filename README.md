# URL Shortener Microservice

Project built for [https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/url-shortener-microservice](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/url-shortener-microservice)

User story:
- I can pass a URL as a parameter and I will receive a shortened URL in the JSON response.
- If I pass an invalid URL that doesn't follow the valid http://www.example.com format, the JSON response will contain an error instead.
- When I visit that shortened URL, it will redirect me to my original link.
- I can get the IP address, language and operating system for my browser.
